Project Overview
=============== 
The Odin Recipes project is the first major assignment in the Foundations
 course of The Odin Project, designed to put basic HTML knowledge into
 practice. It involves creating a bare-bones website consisting of a main
 index page that links to at least three individual recipe pages.

Goals and Focus
===============
HTML Fundamentals: The primary objective is to practice structuring content
 using HTML elements, including headings, paragraphs, images, and lists.

File Management: Students learn to create directories, manage file paths,
 and link HTML files together.

Git Usage: The project requires pushing the completed code to a GitHub
 repository
